# Sensor Anomaly Detection

This project focuses on developing and deploying machine learning models to detect anomalies in numerical data collected from sensors. It leverages various anomaly detection techniques such as One-Class SVM, DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest to identify abnormal behavior in sensor readings, enabling proactive monitoring of systems and early detection of potential failures.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaled the sensor data using StandardScaler and handled missing values.
- **Anomaly Detection Algorithms**:
  - One-Class SVM for novelty detection.
  - DBSCAN for clustering and detecting anomalies based on density.
  - Isolation Forest for identifying anomalies by isolating data points.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Visualized sensor data and anomaly detection results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
  
## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/sensor-anomaly-detection.git
cd sensor-anomaly-detection

Anomaly Detection Models:
One-Class SVM: Detects outliers in high-dimensional sensor data.
DBSCAN: Groups sensor data based on density and identifies outliers.
Isolation Forest: Identifies anomalies by isolating them from the rest of the data.
Project Evaluation
The model evaluation provides the following classification metrics for each model:

Precision: Measure of the model's accuracy in identifying anomalies.
Recall: Measure of the model's ability to correctly identify all anomalies.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Data Visualization
Sensor Data Distribution: Visualized sensor readings to observe trends and outliers.
Anomaly Detection Results: Plotted the anomalies identified by different models, comparing performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to detect abnormal signs in sensor data using different anomaly detection techniques. The performance of each model is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify anomalies in the given dataset. This approach can be utilized for predictive maintenance and early warning systems in various industries.
